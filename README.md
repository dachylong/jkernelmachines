-------------------------------------------------------

JKernelMachines is a java library for learning with kernels. It is primary 
designed to deal with custom kernels that are not easily found in standard 
libraries, such as kernels on structured data.

Examples
--------

Test examples are in the package fr.lip6.test.*. For instance, a test comparing
dual and primal SVM algorithms can be runned by the following command:

java -cp jkernelmachines.jar fr.lip6.test.classifier.TestSimpleSVM
