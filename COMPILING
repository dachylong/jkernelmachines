to compile the library, just use the default ant task. Type ant in a terminal:

$ ant

This should produce the jkernelmachines.jar archive.


To compile documentation, use the doc task:

$ ant doc

Documentation should be in the doc/ directory.
You can generate a jar with documentation files with the docjar target:

$ ant docjar

You can also generate a jar with source files using the sourcejar task:

$ ant sourcejar

A very simple and naive unit testing procedure is available with the test target:

$ ant test

It should not output any warning. If it does and you didn't touch the code at all,
please report it. It is currently very rough and should only be considered as a 
level 0 sanity check for your modifications to the code.

To generate all jars and testing, the full task is available:

$ ant full

It should issue all previous tasks.
