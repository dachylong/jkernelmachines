to compile the library, just use the default ant task. Type ant in a terminal:

$ ant

This should produce the jkernelmachines.jar archive.


To compile documentation, use the doc task:

$ ant doc

Documentation should be in the doc/ directory.
You can generate a jar with documentation files with the docjar target:

$ ant docjar

You can also generate a jar with source files using the sourcejar task:

$ ant sourcejar

A very simple and naive unit testing procedure is available with the test target:

$ ant junit

It should not output any warning. If it does and you didn't touch the code at all,
please report it. 

To generate all jars, the full task is available:

$ ant full

It should issue all previous tasks.
