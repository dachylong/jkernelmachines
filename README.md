JKernelMachines: A simple framework for Kernel Machines
-------------------------------------------------------

JKernelMachines is a java library for learning with kernels. It is primary 
designed to deal with custom kernels that are not easily found in standard 
libraries, such as kernels on structured data.

Features
--------

    Several learning algorithms (LaSVM, SMO, SimpleMKL, GradMKL, QNPKL, SGDQN, Pegasos, ...)
    Datatype agnosticism through Java Generics
    Easy coding of new kernels
    Several standard and exotic kernels (kernel on bags, combination kernels, ...)
    Input system (can read libsvm and csv files)
    Evaluation and Cross Validation packages
    Stand alone (requires only a working jdk and ant for easy compiling)
