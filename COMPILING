JKernelMachines is built using maven. 

The easiest way to use JkernelMachines is to add it as a dependency of your maven projects. You can either use the central repository:

<dependency>
  <groupId>net.jkernelmachines</groupId>
  <artifactId>jkernelmachines</artifactId>
  <version>3.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>

Or build the package yourself and add it to your local repository:

$ mnv install


To produce all the relevant jar files, just run:

$ mvn package

They should appear in the target directory.
